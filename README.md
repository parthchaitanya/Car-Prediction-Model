## 🚗 Car Price Prediction

This project predicts the price of used cars based on various vehicle attributes such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and other features.
The goal is to help users estimate a fair market price using Machine Learning.

📌 Objective

To build and evaluate multiple regression models that can accurately predict car prices and compare their performance.

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

Random Forest Regressor

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor

Random Forest outperformed KNN due to better handling of non-linear relationships and varied feature scales.
